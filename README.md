# bronzeman-mode
A simple implementation of bronzeman mode

When you have have had an item in your inventory once, it will be available to buy from the Grand Exchange.

Use the chat command `!bronzemanunlocks` to see how many items you have unlocked so far.

I will probably add more features in the future.

Suggestions are very welcome!
